                  <p>The Department of Computer Science and Engineering was formed in 1999. Department started its journey with an intake of sixty for undergraduate B.Tech program under University of Kalyani approved by AICTE. Presently the department runs 4-year full time undergraduate B.Tech program with intake capacity increased to 90 in 2010 and 2-year full time post-graduate M.Tech program started from 2012 under West Bengal University of Technology(WBUT) approved by AICTE. Computer Science and Engineering department is also ISO 9001-2008 & ISO 14001-2004 Certified. <span id="toggle_more" data-toggle="collapse" data-target="#toggle_content" style="color:blue">more..</span></p>

                  <p>Both JEM and AIEEE merit listed candidates shall have to adhere to the cut-off marks in qualifying exam (10+2) as per norms. For lateral entry students should be Diploma holders in Engineering/Technological have to pass Diploma Examination from an AICTE approved Institution. B.Sc. Degree holders have to pass B.Sc. from a UGC recognized University with at least 45% marks and also have to pass XII standard with Mathematics as a subject. Diploma and B.Sc. Degree holders have to be merit listed in the JELET-2014 conducted by West Bengal Joint Entrance Examinations Board to become eligible for admission under Lateral Entry Scheme. The post-graduate students get admitted through GATE and PGET examinations. Some of them avail teaching assistantship under TEQIP and remain engaged in various departmental works whereas GATE qualified students are entitled for scholarship from the MHRD Department of the Govt. of India. </p>
                  <p>Academic performance of the students of this department is quite remarkable as they are technically very sound and get placed in well reputed IT industry like Intel, Microsoft, Infosys, IBM, TCS, Cognizant, Tech Mahindra, Capgemini, Wipro etc with great success also numerous alumni from the above industry come to this department to organize student workshop, technical seminar, training etc. </p>
                  <p>Department has well modernized exclusive classrooms for B.Tech & M.Tech program and the department possesses exclusive laboratories named Computer Organization Lab, Computer Networking Lab, Computer Programming Lab, Computer System Lab, Computer Architecture & Embedded System Lab, PG Research Lab and Project Lab also there are other 7 shared labs in this department. Also the Seminar Room, Tutorial rooms, Faculty rooms, Departmental Library are well modernized.</p>
                  <p>There is Departmental Advisory Board whose external members are from industries (TCS & CDAC), research institute (ISI & VECC), university/ institute, who meet as and when required in the department to discuss about different academic courses, project & research activities & collaborative program with the different industries from where the students and staff of this department improves their credential in research and academic field.</p>
                  <p>The department realize that NBA accreditation is essential for not only strengthening its various academic activities but for obtaining autonomy and continuing TEQIP and other similar facilities. In order to achieve the target mission and vision and program educational objectives for the graduate engineers, it is utmost important to establish outcome based model recommended by NBA for quality education. This model not only emphasizes on the graduate attributes but also suggest suitable changes in curriculum, learning-teaching process, content delivery, assessment rubrics etc. Students will definitely be benefitted for better employment and entrepreneurship. Moreover, NBA accreditation also facilitates to draw various research grants for the Department. On the whole, NBA accreditation is really necessary for potential improvement in the learning teaching process as well as to add more values in the research activities.
                  The department provides an outstanding research environment complemented by excellence in teaching. Since its beginning the department has created soaring impression among the industrialists, academics and students and the journey is going ahead with continuous effort by its excellent faculties, staffs and students.<span id="toggle_less" data-toggle="collapse" data-target="#toggle_content" style="color:blue"> less..</span></p>
